Build: The birdhouse firmware builder and uploader

Usage:
    build.py <winscpprofile> (all | <devices>) [--clean] 
    build.py build [--clean]
    build.py build --help


Arguments:
    winscpprofile     Profile used to connect to server in WinSCP
    devicelist        List of devices to upload to: e.g. 2,3,4,5 | 2-6 | 4,6-8,13 | all

Options:
    -b --buildonly    Build code, but do not upload
    -c --clean        Overwrite existing built firmware image
